#  Shell Scripting 

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository documents my **complete Shell Scripting learning and practice journey**. It contains hands-on Bash scripts created while learning Linux, focusing on **real-world system administration and DevOps automation tasks**.

Each script is written with clarity and simplicity in mind, demonstrating core shell concepts that are commonly used in **Cloud & DevOps environments**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Build strong Linux & Bash fundamentals
* Automate day-to-day system administration tasks
* Practice real-world scripting logic used in DevOps
* Write clean, readable, and reusable shell scripts
